A web app for managing your team

This is a web app to help handball coaches managing their teams. The main functionalities to implement are 3:

- An assistance checklist of players coming to trainings.
- Stats (the data stats will be taken by a front-end interface).

The future objectives are:

Being able to add visible info for anyone from the club.
